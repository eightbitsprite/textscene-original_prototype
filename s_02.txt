The scene is set in McCree's room. It's rather sparsely furnished - except for a single framed photo, the walls are bare. The bed is neatly made, and the smooth metal desk McCree is seated at has only a couple papers resting on top of it. 

McCree is currently reading Mark Twain's Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc. Soft guitar emanates from the compact speaker nearby.

A knock is heard on the door. McCree looks up, and puts down the book.

@McCree: Door's open.

He stands up as Lucio enters. Lucio looks uncomfortable.

@Lucio: You wanted to see me?

@McCree Look, I was thinkin' about last night.

@Lucio [Suddenly] I'm sorry.#0.5

@McCree What?

Lucio looks over at the wall to the right, avoiding eye contact.

@Lucio Look, I get it, all right? I shouldn't have just...

He trails off.

@McCree [Wryly] Tried to give me some sugar?

@Lucio [Startled] What?

McCree starts to smirk.

@McCree Kiss me, I mean.

@Lucio [Blushing] No! I mean yes! I mean, I shouldn't have assumed that you...

He stops talking and looks awkwardly to the side.

@McCree Assumed what?

@Lucio [Perplexed] I thought it was pretty obvious.

@McCree [Amused] What was?

He hits a button on the speaker next to him. The track changes.

@Lucio [Irritated] Hey, man. You don't have to be a dick about this. I thought you were interested. You aren't. You don't have to-

@McCree Oh, I ain't? #.5

He's grinning. Lucio stops and stares at McCree #.75

@Lucio Wait. What do you-

McCree bends over and pulls him into a kiss. 

It's quickly returned.#.5

The music on the radio continues to play. It's only until the first verse starts that it becomes evident the current track is Christina Perri's "A Thousand Years". When Lucio notices, his eyes snap open and he breaks out of the kiss.#2

@McCree [Nervously] Lucio?

@Lucio Jesse, did you *plan* this?

McCree turns his head and pointedly does not answer. Lucio starts laughing.

@Lucio Haha, you're such a dork!

He pauses for a bit, and listens to the song. 

He starts laughing again.

@Lucio And- and- *this* song? It's ancient! And it's pop!

@McCree [Grumpily] What'd you expect? *Country*?

He spits the last word out with disdain.#.5

Lucio just laughs even harder. McCree crosses his arms and glares.

@McCree: You done? #1.5

@Lucio: Sorry, man. Just assumed you'd be a Dylan guy, if anything.

Lucio gradually works himself down to chuckling. When he finally stops, the two of them look at each other.

They're both smiling. #.5

@Lucio So... you and me?

@McCree[Gently]: For as long as you'll have me.

@Lucio [Drawling]: Until we ride into the sunset, then.

@McCree: If that's the way you want it.

End.
