HAPPENSTANCE
by Peter Sagal #.75

@Martin: Yes. WE'll do that.

He puts the phone back in his pocket. Does his best to look casual. Looks into

manages a look of utter distraction just as Amy walks by.

@Martin[Surprised.] Amy?

@Amy: Martin!

They look at each other.

@Amy: What a ...

@Martin: I mean, once was crazy enough...

@Amy: Coincidence, exactly. Wow. You're...

@Martin: Heading home. And you...

@Amy: Yeah. A week in Albuquerque. And you were...

@Martin: St. Paul. Was it a good time?

@Amy: Fine. Yeah.

@Amy: Wow. I mean, I wonder if something is going on...

@Martin: Like what?

@Amy: I mean... I see you, first time in forever, in an airport, for god's
sakes, and then, one week later...

@Martin: It's O'Hare. Busiest airport in the world. Wait here long enough, you'd
meet J.D. Salinger.

@Amy: But still. Twice in a week? Not happenstance.

@Martin: Happen...?

@Amy: I read it once. Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is
enemy action.

@Martin: Let's not do this again, then.
